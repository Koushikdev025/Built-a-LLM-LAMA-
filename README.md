LLaMA4-Inspired Language Model
This project is a custom implementation of a transformer-based large language model, inspired by Meta's LLaMA 4 architecture. It focuses on efficient training, scalable attention, and modular design for experimentation and fine-tuning.

ðŸš€ Features
Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention

LLaMA-style token embeddings and rotary position encodings

Configurable depth, heads, and hidden size

Trained on custom or open datasets

Supports training, sampling, and inference

Lightweight and research-friendly

ðŸ§  Model Goals
Reproducibility of modern LLM behaviors

Customization for task-specific fine-tuning

Emphasis on memory-efficient forward/backward passes
